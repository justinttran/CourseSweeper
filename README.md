# Course Sweeper

Inspired by Course Sniper at Rutgers University.

Checks the Cornell Course Roster every 15 minutes and sends an email if a course that you are tracking is open (will only send the email once).

Can only update as fast as the Cornell Course Roster does.  There can be discrepancies between Student Center and the Course Roster, so you are not guaranteed a spot in the class by using this application.
