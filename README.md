# Course Sweeper

Inspired by Course Sniper at Rutgers University.

Checks the Cornell Course Roster every 10 minutes and sends an email if a course that you are tracking is open (will only send the email once).

Can only update as fast as the Cornell Course Roster does (its fastest update speed is 10 minutes from 6am to 5pm, according to the Roster FAQ).  There may be discrepancies between Student Center and the Course Roster.
